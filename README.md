# 🔥 FireNotes

**FireNotes** is an **offline-first notes application** built with **React + Supabase** that works seamlessly even without an internet connection.  
Notes are cached locally, synced intelligently, and resolved automatically when conflicts occur.

> ✨ Built to demonstrate **custom offline architecture**, **real-time sync**, and modern backend engineering

## 🧠 Why FireNotes?

Most apps break when the internet drops.  
**FireNotes doesn’t.**

Instead of relying on built-in backend persistence, FireNotes implements a **custom offline-first architecture**:

- Local caching using IndexedDB  
- Write queue for offline mutations  
- Version-based conflict resolution  
- Intelligent sync engine with Supabase backend  

This makes FireNotes:

- Resilient  
- Predictable  
- Scalable  
- Production-ready

## 🏗 Architecture Overview

FireNotes follows a layered architecture:

- **UI Layer** – React + Tailwind CSS  
- **Application Layer** – Use cases & orchestration  
- **Domain Layer** – Business logic & sync engine  
- **Infrastructure Layer** – Supabase client + IndexedDB  

This separation ensures scalability and clean system boundaries.
